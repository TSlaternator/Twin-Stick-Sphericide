# Top Down Shooter Project

Created for a second year module 'AI for Games'

My first attempt at game dev, but I had a lot of fun with it!

Warning1: Game is only playable if using a plugged in controller due to being a 'twin stick' shooter. Tested with a 360 controller

Warning2: I never got around to implementing a 'restart' feature, so you'll have to ```Alt-F4``` in order to quit...
